		<p><em>Friends! Hope you’ve all had a great start to 2017.</em> My days have mostly been about trying to get back into work, and finding a routine again. It’s so hard after the holidays! If I skip checking my email for a week, it’s a real struggle to get back into it. I need to write to-do lists for every day, by hand, in my calendar and then strike things off my list as I go, to get motivated. Needless to say, my 2017 calendar is still pretty empty. But I hope that will change soon!</p>

		<p>Do you guys have any goals or resolutions for 2017? I usually don’t, but if I were to pick something it would be to have more fun, laugh more, relax more and try not to worry about every. single. thing. Take better care of myself too. And to do things that make me happy.</p>

		<p>Now, this cake! I loooove citrus season and especially blood oranges have a special place in my heart (and my belly, hah!). Also, they make the prettiest pink </p>
	
		<p>don’t know about you, but for me Halloween has always been all about the candy. The costume was simply necessary in order to get said candy. I’m pretty sure I was a witch for many years simply so that I’d have a costume and could go trick-or-treating.

		<p>And when it came to candy – the more, the better. We’d go door to door for hours. Then when my brother and I were done trick-or-treating, we’d pour all our candy out onto the floor, sort it and then trade the candy we didn’t like for other candy. Of course Butterfingers have always been a big hit. Who can resist the crunch and the peanut butter?!

    	These cupcakes really are the most delicious way to eat a Butterfinger. The cupcake is light, fluffy and full of peanut butter. And to make sure it has that extra special Butterfinger flavor, it has bits of the candy that are crushed up and added right to the batter. Just a tip – if you have a food chopper, that was the easiest and quickest way to crush up the Butterfinger. Worked like a charm!

		<li>Once the cupcakes are baked, they are topped with a little layer of chocolate ganache. I thought the chocolate would break up the peanut butter a bit, plus Butterfingers are covered in chocolate, so it’s totally necessary. ☺ You could even drizzle a little chocolate over the top, if you like.</li>

		<li>Sitting atop the cupcakes is a peanut butter frosting that is again filled with crushed Butterfingers. The combination of everything is perfectly </peanut butter-y with the distinct flavor of Butterfinger. Perfection!

		<li>I shared these with friends and they were a big hit! At first they claimed they were too pretty to eat, but they quickly got past that and devoured them all. I hope you enjoy them too!</li>
